\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

% No one will tell you writing a thesis is easy, but this has been a greater
% challenge that I could have imagined. This work is down to the help, support
% and advice of many people, some of whom I will acknowledge here, others who
% will hopefully not read this and not realise they've been left out.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Jeremy Pitt, for firstly agreeing to have me
as a PhD student, but mainly for being an constant source of interesting ideas and discussions.
Thank you for entrusting me to take forward the work on the Knowledge
Commons, which provided a unique opportunity to apply ideas from an array of
disciplines, and proved a highly engaging and interesting problem domain.

Thanks to the other academics I have had the pleasure to work with during this
PhD. Brendan Neville, whose brainchild Presage formed a base for me to start
from, and saved me from having to invent a clever name for my software;
D\'{\i}dac Busquets, with whom I published two papers and a book chapter; and
Julia Schaumeier, whose work I built upon in this thesis.

To my colleagues from the Intelligent Systems and Networks groups, with whom I
have spent various parts of the last four years with, who have provided much
needed social support during that time. Special thanks go to (again) Julia
Schaumeier, Pedro Costa and Miguel Sarabia who were always on hand with help,
encouragement, or just gossip.

Finally, thanks go to my family and friends for providing support, and much-
needed extra-curricular activities.
