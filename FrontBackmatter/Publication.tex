\chapter*{Publications}
Some ideas and figures have appeared previously in the following publications involving the author:

\bigskip

\paragraph{Self-organising management of user-generated data and
knowledge}  presents our review of participatory-sensing applications and the framework for the management of participatory
sensing as a knowledge commons, and according to Ostrom's principles. This
paper covers much of the same ground as \autoref{ch:kc} and \autoref{sec:iad}
of this thesis~\citep{MacbethKER2014}.

\paragraph{Principled Operationalisation of social systems using
Presage2} presents the use of the Presage2 simulation
platform for the purpose of Principled Operationalisation, as per the
sociologically-inspired computing methodology. This is done through the
description of the design and implementation of simulations of a linear public
good game, and the Kyoto Protocol. Some of the figures and description of the
Presage2 platform also appear in \autoref{ch:presage}~\citep{Macbeth2014}.

\paragraph{Distributive Justice for Self-Organised Common-Pool Resource
Management} discusses the application of the theory of
Distributive Justice, as described by Nicholas Rescher, to common-pool
resource management. My contribution was the implementation of the simulation
model, using Presage2, and the collection of results through controlled
experimentation~\citep{Pitt2014}.

\paragraph{Animation of Self-Organising Resource Allocation Using
Presage2} is a demonstration and poster, describing the
implementation of a resource-allocation problem using Presage2, and the
animation and visualisation of this problem~\citep{Macbeth2012}.

\paragraph{Animation of open multi-agent systems} presents a
case study of the Presage platform's use for the simulation and animation of
four different multi-agent systems~\citep{Pitt2011}.
