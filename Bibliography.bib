annote = { The Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickups and Deliveries (VRPPD) is an extension to the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), where customers may both receive and send goods. We do not make the assumption common in the VRPPD literature, that goods may only be picked up after all deliveries have been completed. We also eschew the concept of insertion and propose a method that treats pickups and deliveries in an integrated manner. This method finds a solution to the corresponding VRP problem and modifies this solution to make it feasible for the VRPPD. Such modification is achieved mainly by heuristic routines taken from VRP methodology but modified such that their aim becomes the reduction of infeasibilities, although a number of problem-specific routines are also constructed. To render our procedures efficient when checking feasibility, we built appropriate mathematical relationships to describe changes in the maximum load of routes. Furthermore, several enhancements are introduced. Our methodology is also capable of solving multi-depot problems, which has not been done before for this challenging general version of the VRPPD. The methods are tested for single and multiple depot problems with encouraging results.},

annote = {We consider the multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem (MVPDP) with the objective of minimizing the total travel cost and the fixed vehicle cost. Most of the optimization-based approaches for solving the MVPDP are developed for a restrictive hard time window or tight capacity environment that depend significantly on the reduction of the feasible solution space. We develop an alternative optimization solution approach for the MVPDP that does not require these constraints to be tight. The problem is formulated as a 0-1 integer-programming problem. A branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to optimally solve the problem. Four classes of valid inequalities for the MVPDP are proposed. By using the proposed solution approach, we were able to optimally solve problem instances of up to 5 vehicles and 17 customers on problems without clusters and up to 5 vehicles and 25 customers on problems with clusters within a stopping criterion of three CPU hours on a SUN Fire 4800 server. \{[\}ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR\{]\}},
